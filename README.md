# Building the Andromeda Optical & Infrared Disk Survey (ANDROIDS)

Thanks to its proximity, the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is an ideal laboratory for understanding spiral galaxy structure and stellar populations. Thus we created the Andromeda Optical and Infrared Disk Survey (ANDROIDS) to map the entire bulge and disk of M31 in six optical and near-IR bands, across 14 sq. deg. and five gigapixels, using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. ANDROIDS offers a dual view of stellar populations from both unresolved light and resolved stars, allowing a test of the reliability of unresolved spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling â€” a ubiquitous tool for understanding galaxy evolution. Mapping SEDs over such a wide footprint pushed the limits of surface brightness calibration, and required novel approaches to sky monitoring, sky offset optimization, and hierarchical modelling of stellar populations and background residuals. I describe how we addressed the practical challenges that such a vast dataset entails by adopting industrial tools like MongoDB to orchestrate the ANDROIDS pipeline and PostGIS to manage the star catalog assembly.  I close with a discussion about the tools and infrastructure that medium scale surveys, like ANDROIDS, need in order to cope with the expanding data volumes of modern observatories.
