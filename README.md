# Building the Andromeda Optical & Infrared Disk Survey (ANDROIDS)

The Andromeda Optical and Infrared Disk Survey (ANDROIDS) has mapped the entire bulge and disk of M31 in six optical and near-IR bands, across 14 sq. deg. and five gigapixels, using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. ANDROIDS offers a dual view of stellar populations from both unresolved light and resolved stars, allowing a test of the reliability of unresolved spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling. Mapping SEDs over such a wide footprint pushed the limits of surface brightness calibration, and required novel approaches to sky monitoring, sky offset optimization, and hierarchical modelling of stellar populations and background residuals. I describe how we addressed the practical challenges that such a vast dataset entails by adopting industrial tools like MongoDB to orchestrate the ANDROIDS pipeline.
