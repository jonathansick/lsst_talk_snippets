# Lessons from Medium Data Astronomy: The Andromeda Optical & Infrared Disk Survey (ANDROIDS)

How well do we estimate stellar populations from the unresolved spectral energy distributions of galaxies? To answer this we have undertaken a survey of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), where integrated spectral energy distributions, and the resolved stars underlying them, are simultaneously observable. With the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope's MegaCam and WIRCam cameras we cover 14 sq. deg. of the M31 disk in ugriJKs bands. This project pushes the limits of wide-field surface brightness calibration, requiring novel approaches to sky monitoring, sky offset optimization, and hierarchical modelling of stellar populations and background residuals. This work also typifies what may be called 'medium data' astronomy: work that can be addressed by a small team on a minimal budget, but requires smart software investment to manage the dataset. I will show how we adopt industrial tools like MongoDB to orchestrate the ANDROIDS pipeline, and PostGIS to manage star catalog assembly. The talk will close with a discussion of what tools and infrastructure medium scale surveys, like ANDROIDS, need to keep up with the expanding data volumes of modern observatories.
